Arrays -  do not have inbuilt data structures and algorithms.
there is only one property - length
Fixed in size
Store the similar type of data in general ,,, we can have different type of data in array not in general

Collection is interface which is available in java.util package.

Collection Inbuilt Methods

In Collection we use add method.

boolean add(Object o)
int size()
boolean contains(Object o)
boolean remove(Object o)
boolean isEmpty(Object o)
boolean equals(Object o)
void clear()
int hashCode()
boolean retainAll(Collection c)
boolean addAll(Collection c)
boolean containsAll(Collection c)
boolean removeAll(Collection c)

Array List is a class , gives implimentation for all the method of collection, implimentation class

List is index Based Collection
List is ordered
Lis is a sub interface of collection
List can allow duplicates
List can allow null values
It preserves insersion order- how we add the data based on that we'll get output

ArrayList:-
It preserves insersion order- how we add the data based on that we'll get output
It is implemntation class of list.
Default value of ArrayList is 10.
Array List stores data in sequesntial order
ArrayList follow one data structure - resizable array or dynamic array
If we fetch 11 index array list will grow
Functionality of ArrayList is grow();  (grow method)
Formula for arrayList when we add 11th value - int newCapacity = oldCapacity + (oldCapacity >>1);
Binary form -   8 4 2 1
Binary for 10 - 1 0 1 0
                 1 0 1 0
Search concept is faster in ArraList than LinkedList
Search operation is faster in ArraList reason is it interfaces RandomAccess

RandomAccess, Clonable, serializable

LinkedList:-
Does not have any default size
Grows elemnt by 1.-size of LinkedList is 1.
Doesnot store data in sequential order it will in random. 
LinkedList is based on NODE. 1 data means 1Node means 2 values.
Node have 3 information - 1)previous elemnt address 2)value 3)next elemnt address.
LinkedList follows structure - doubly Linked List.

Difference btw arraylist and HashSet

Vector - grow based on double of capacity.  smlr to arylst

Stack

Set Interface of collection
it doesnot allow duplicates
doesnot preserves insertion order
basic implementation of set is hashset.

HashSet is implementation class of set
LinkedHashSet does not follow duplicate          globle array, doubly linked,

How set store unique data?

MAP- we use put method , it is a interface
store the value in the form of key and value.

set act as map
