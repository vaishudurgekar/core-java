1)Java is not fully object oriented language.

2)Java Features
     Simple - java human understandable programing language so java is simple.
	 Secure - 
	 Object Oriented
	 Multithread
	 Robust
	 Architectured
	 portable
	 Interpreted
	 High performance
	 Distributed 
	 Dynamic

3)JVM- Java Vertual Machine
   JRE - Java Runtime Environment

4)JDK- Java Development Kit. It includes JRE and other development kit. It is used to develop the software.
  JRE - Java Runtime Environment. It includes JVM and set libraries.  It is used to run the program.
  JVM - Java Vertual Machine. It converts byte code to native code. It used to lolads the code, verify the code and execute the code.

5) Byte code - JVM converts source code to byte code it is called byte code

6) Class - It is blueprint or a plan.
   Object - It is instance of a class.

7)Class signature-
class ClassName{
    public static void main(String a[]){
	  SOP("");
	}
}
Method signature - 
Access modifier returnType methodName(parameter){
 
}

8)Variable is container which hold data. There are four types
  *static variable - Variable that have static keyword called static variable. It is class variable. It is declared in outside the method and inside the class. It is declared once at the time of the execution.
  *Instance variable - It is declare inside the class and outside the method
  *Local variable - It is declare inside the method in the same class.
  *Parameterised variable - It is used to pass the variable

9)Static variable- It is class variable. Variable that have static keyword. It is declared in outside the method and inside the class. It is declared once at the time of the execution.
  Instatnce variable - It is delaced within the class and outside the class.

10)Static method - Method having static variables called static method.
   Instatnce method - Method having instance variable called instance method.

11)No we can't use more than one main method in java

12)No we cannot use identifiers name as variable name

13)Basic unit of storage in program is bite

14)Yes 

15)Use of static keyword is to declare static variable and to call static method

16)Use of this keyword is to avoid cofusion/ambigity between local and instatnce variable
   Use of this() - To call another method in constructor

17)error - Access modifier always start with lowercase

18)

19)Using new keyword we can create object

20)Constructor is a special type of method which is used to initialise the object.

21)Constructor doesnot have any returnType but method does have returntype

22)Types of constructor 
   *Default constructor - Either the developer or java compiler can declare the costructor. It there is no constructor the java compiler will declare the default constructor by default.
         Access modifier 
   *Parameterised constructor - Constructor  having parameter list that is either number of parameter or type of parameter.

23)use of super keyword is to call immediate parent member.
    use of this keyword is to avoid the amigity between the local and instance variable.
	
24)Yes

25)

26)

27)

28)Method overloading - The class having multiple method called method overloading.
   Method overriding - It is the process of providing certain implimentation to a sub class method and it is possible only in inheritance

29)class Arrays{
      public static void main(String a[]){
	    int array[] ={1,2,3,4,5,6,7};
	
	    System.out.println("Odd Numbers");
	      for(int i=0; i< array.length;i++){
	       System.out.println(array[i]);
	      }
	
	     System.out.println("Even number");
	      for(int i=0; i< array.length;i++){
	       System.out.println(array[i]);
          }
     }
    }

30)If we fetch more than the known size of the array then we get ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException error.

31)

32)class AssendingOrder{

     public static void main(String a[]){
	   for(int i=1;i<10;i++){
	     System.out.println("Assending order:" + i);
	   }
	 }
}

33)*Inheritance
   *Polymorphism
   *Encapsulation
   *Abstraction

34) Super keyword is used to call immediate parent member
