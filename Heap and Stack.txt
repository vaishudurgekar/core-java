Jvm will call GC mechanism in Eden memory- Garbage Collector, multiple times call, young gen -name is minorGC
All the memory in young gen filled will moved to old gen -majorGC.
We can cl GC
Memory address will alocated
                    
                            JVM architecture
                                 
Main purpose stack- exicute methods one after the other, before and after exicution stack memory will be empty.
Main purpose heap - store objects.
Method area or peramemt generation- classnames, static variable, final variable
instance and local variable stored in memory address in prticular memory
All primitive stored in stavk

SCP-String Constatnt Pool. in heap old memory - will come into pic when we create object with the help of literals.
String related data will store in heap in that SCP. -literals object.
Using new keyword object created store in outside SCP.
Equal method compare content of an object. It is used to compare value of object.
== is used to compare address of any two objects or reference variable.


Object stored in heap addressed by reference
Stack is also called class.

To make java purely object oriented we have corresponding class called wraper class
java.lang package all wraper cls will be available. java.lang- default package
Boxing - auto and 

warper cls can 2 types - 1 is using new keyword (Int int = new Int(23);), 2 is using literal(value-Int it=32;).
we can create warper and string class without using new.
Properties of warper class.

All type of warper class default value is null- (its class- ex.Integer)
String type of value is considered with the help of .equals(baba)
one value is null we are  ecessing any method or variable from one value we will always land up with NULLPOINTEREXCEPTION.
To compare String type variable we will use equals method(i.e .equals())

Multiple charecter in single variable we use charecter array

String is a class, sequence of charecter.
String object are inmutable-means cannot change the content of an object - new object created with new reference variable
For String mutablility we use StringBuilder or StringBuffer - two string related objects 
+ is not supported to stringbuilder and stringbuffer use .append() only for string.
Concatinaton operator- +, .append()
To avoid concatination btw String and Stringbuilder .append() will use
StringBuilder and StringBuffer are mutable in nature.

in string we have + method also concat().
How to have a inmutable class in java?
We can overload the final class but cant override.- method
final variable cannot be int - variable
final class cannot be inherited.- class.

Exception is a abnormal condition or unexpeted event or unwanted event which ouurs in the execution of the program and it updraft the normal flow of the code.
Two type of handler is in jvm - defaualt handler and catch.
In catch block - 
   printStactTrace() is used to get details about exception.
All the exception is in java is class at compile time but reun time is object.
Types of exception - Parent exception- RunTimeException is also class, we can also give ingeritance example for exception
Compile time exception also calle checked
Difference between Errors and Exception

throws - willing to not handle the exception. help us to specify the exception
 Syntax for throws - access modifier  return type  methodName()  throws  nameOfException{
          }

Syntax for forName() is - forname("ClassName")  throws  ClassNotFoundException
stackVinding also called as exception propagation - handlig using throws keyword
throw is used inside the method and throws used with methodsignature.
Exception extends exception get compileTime Exception, Exception extends Runtimeexception get Unchecked exception.

finally {   -close all the costly resourses, used after the catch block, will be executed wtheter the exeptiom occurs or not
 }

Difference btw final , finally , finalize
